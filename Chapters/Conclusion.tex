\chapter{Conclusion}
\todo[inline]{General directions to continue this line of work. There are mainly three directions at the moment}
\section{Applications to Security Analysis}
\todo[inline]{A wonderful assertion: no spatial transformation breaks the property behaviour of a system. This implies that an attacker needs to change the program itself, and that model is beyond state integrity.}
\section{Applications to Program Repair}
\todo[inline]{We can ourselves morph the state. If we find that some transformations, like the ones we used for program repair, enforce a behavioural property but respect functionality, then we can apply them!}
\section{Applications to Program Synthesis}
\todo[inline]{A curious problem: if you have a set of ``gadgets'' defined by an $F$-coalgebra, can you combine them to satisfy a specification?}
