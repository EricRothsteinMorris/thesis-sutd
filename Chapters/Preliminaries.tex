There should be a bit of redundancy with the glossary at the end, but I feel it makes the thesis easier to navigate: search preliminaries, and you're there.

\section{Sets and Functions}
We say that an endofunction $f\colon X \rightarrow X$ has finite support iff $f(x)\neq x$ for a finite number of $x$ in $X$.

\subsection{Categories and Functors}
%\todo[inline]{*Puts an Edna Mode face* NO MONADS (unless necessary)}
%\subsection{$\Monad$-algebras, $\Functor$-coalgebras and $\lambda$-bialgebras}
\subsection{$F$-coalgebras and their Homomorphisms}
An \emph{$F$-coalgebra} for a functor $F$ is a pair $(X,X\xrightarrow{c}F(X))$ of an object $X$ and a morphism $c\colon X\rightarrow F(X)$. We use $F$-coalgebras to model dynamic systems with state. 
\begin{example}
We can model systems whose states have one component of type $O$ and that can perform state transitions on inputs of type $I$ by means of the functor $F(X)=O\times X^I$. An $F-$coalgebra is of the form $(X,X\xrightarrow{(o,\delta)}O\times X^I)$, with $o\colon X\rightarrow O$ and $\delta\colon X\rightarrow X^I$; the function $o$ lets us explore the component in the state $x$, and $\delta$ lets us perform transitions. We often write $x.o$ instead of $o(x)$, and we write $x^i$ as a shorthand for $\delta(x)(i)$. Deterministic automata that recognise sequences from an alphabet $A$ can be modelled with coalgebras of the functor $G(X)=2\times X^A$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Pointed coalgebras}
Pointed coalgebras are coalgebras with a distinguished state, usually referred to as the \emph{initial state}. Formally, for a functor $F$, a pointed $F$-coalgebra is a triple $(X,c, x_0)$ where $(X,c)$ is an $F$-coalgebra and $x_0\in X$.
\subsection{States and Components}
We often use vectors/tuples as a states. We access the values inside states by means of projection functions. If the carrier is a product set $\vec{X}=Y_1 \times\ldots Y_n$, we can use, for $j=1..n$, the projection functions $\pi_j\colon \vec{X}\rightarrow Y_j$ defined, for $\vec{x}=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$, by $\pi_j(\vec{x})\triangleq v_j$. In this case, we say that $\pi_1$ to $\pi_n$ are the \emph{components} of $\vec{X}$ and its elements. Since both coalgebras and components are functions from the carrier, we use bracket notation for component to distinguish them, i.e., we write $\vec{x}[\pi_j]$ instead of $\pi_j(\vec{x})$.  %, or, alternatively the \emph{state variables} of states in $X$. 
Whenever we write a state or a carrier  with arrows above them (i.e., $\vec{x}$ or $\vec{X}$), we imply that they have more than one component. Note that if the carrier $X$ has only one component, then it must be the identity function $\id\colon X\rightarrow X$. 
\todo[inline]{Consider $\vec{x}.\pi_j$ too, called dot notation}
%A \emph{$\Monad$-algebra} for a monad $\Monad=(\MFunctor,\eta,\mu)$ is a pair $(\TheSet,\Monad(\TheSet)\xrightarrow{a}\TheSet)$ of an object $\TheSet$ and a morphism $a\colon \Monad(\TheSet)\rightarrow\TheSet$ which, due to the relationship between monads and adjunctions, satisfies two properties: the \emph{multiplication square} and the \emph{unit triangle}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MultiplicationSquare}.

\todo[inline]{THERE IS NO NEED FOR MONADS AT THE MOMENT. Monads seem to be what maps a type $X$ to an initial/final $F$-coalgebra of a functor where $X$ is constant}

\subsection{Anamorphisms and Final $F$-Coalgebras}
Formally, for the functor $F=O\times \texttt{id}^I$, given an $F$-coalgebra $\mathbb{X}=(X,(o,\delta))$, the behaviour of a state $x\in X$ is $\TheBehaviourOfIn{x}{\mathbb{X}}$, an element of the set $O^{I^*}$.
