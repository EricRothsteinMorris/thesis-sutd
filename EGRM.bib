@inproceedings{ROP2,
	abstract = {This paper reconsiders the threat posed by Shacham's "return-oriented programming" -- a technique by which W-xor-X-style hardware protections are evaded via carefully crafted stack frames that divert control flow into the middle of existing variable-length x86 instructions -- creating short new instructions streams that then return. We believe this attack is both more general and a greater threat than the author appreciated. In fact, the vulnerability is not limited to the x86 architecture or any particular operating system, is readily exploitable, and bypasses an entire category of malware protections. In this paper we demonstrate general return-oriented programming on the SPARC, a fixed instruction length RISC architecture with structured control flow. We construct a Turing-complete library of code gadgets using snippets of the Solaris libc, a general purpose programming language, and a compiler for constructing return-oriented exploits. Finally, we argue that the threat posed by return-oriented programming, across all architectures and systems, has negative implications for an entire class of security mechanisms: those that seek to prevent malicious computation by preventing the execution of malicious code.},

@inproceedings{FastInterpolatingBMC,
	Abstract = {Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is well known for its simplicity and ability to find counterexamples. It is based on the idea of symbolically representing counterexamples in a transition system and then using a SAT solver to check for their existence or their absence. State-of-the-art BMC algorithms combine a direct translation to SAT with circuit-aware simplifications and work incrementally, sharing information between different bounds. While BMC is incomplete (it can only show existence of counterexamples), it is a major building block of several complete interpolation-based model checking algorithms. However, traditional interpolation is incompatible with optimized BMC. Hence, these algorithms rely on simple BMC engines that significantly hinder their performance. In this paper, we present a Fast Interpolating BMC (Fib) that combines state-of-the-art BMC techniques with interpolation. We show how to interpolate in the presence of circuit-aware simplifications and in the context of incremental solving. We evaluate our implementation of Fib in AVY, an interpolating property directed model checker, and show that it has a great positive effect on the overall performance. With the Fib, AVY outperforms ABC implementation of Pdr on both HWMCC'13 and HWMCC'14 benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{EfficientComputationOfRecurrenceDiameters,
	Abstract = {SAT based Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is an efficient method for detecting logical errors in finite-state transition systems. Given a transition system, an LTL property, and a user defined bound k, a bounded model checker generates a propositional formula that is satisfiable if and only if a counterexample to the property of length up to k exists. Standard SAT checkers can be used to check this formula.BMCis complete if k is larger than some pre-computed threshold. It is still unknown how to compute this threshold for general properties.We show that the longest initialized loop-free path in the state graph, also known as the recurrence diameter, is sufficient for Fp properties. The recurrence diameter is also a known over-approximation for the threshold of simple safety properties (Gp).We discuss various techniques to compute the recurrence diameter efficiently and provide experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of using the new approach.},

@inproceedings{ProvingMorePropertiesWithBMC,
	Abstract = {Bounded Model Checking, although complete in theory, has been thus far limited in practice to falsification of properties that were not invariants. In this paper we propose a termination criterion for all of LTL, and we show its effectiveness through experiments. Our approach is based on converting the LTL formula to a B{\"u}chi automaton so as to reduce model checking to the verification of a fairness constraint. This reduction leads to one termination criterion that applies to all formulae. We also discuss cases for which a dedicated termination test improves bounded model checking efficiency.},

@book{ActualCausality,
	Abstract = {Causality plays a central role in the way people structure the world; we constantly seek causal explanations for our observations. But what does it even mean that an eventC"actually caused" eventE? The problem of defining actual causation goes beyond mere philosophical speculation. For example, in many legal arguments, it is precisely what needs to be established in order to determine responsibility. The philosophy literature has been struggling with the problem of defining causality since Hume.In this book, Joseph Halpern explores actual causality, and such related notions as degree of responsibility, degree of blame, and causal explanation. The goal is to arrive at a definition of causality that matches our natural language usage and is helpful, for example, to a jury deciding a legal case, a programmer looking for the line of code that cause some software to fail, or an economist trying to determine whether austerity caused a subsequent depression.Halpern applies and expands an approach to causality that he and Judea Pearl developed, based on structural equations. He carefully formulates a definition of causality, and building on this, defines degree of responsibility, degree of blame, and causal explanation. He concludes by discussing how these ideas can be applied to such practical problems as accountability and program verification. Technical details are generally confined to the final section of each chapter and can be skipped by non-mathematical readers.},

@inproceedings{CPSProfiles,
	Abstract = {Attacker models are a fundamental part of research on security of any system. For different application scenarios, suitable attacker models have to be chosen to allow comprehensive coverage of possible attacks. We consider Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), that typically consist of networked embedded systems which are used to sense, actuate, and control physical processes. The physical layer aspects of such systems add novel attack vectors and opportunities for defenses, that require extended models of attackers' capabilities. We develop a taxonomy to classify and compare attacker models in related work. We show that, so far, there are no commonly used attacker models for such CPS. In addition, concepts of what information belongs in an attacker model are widely different among the community. To address that problem, we develop a framework to classify attacker models and use it to review related work on CPS Security. Using our framework, we propose a set of attacker profiles and show that those profiles capture most types of attackers described in the related work. Our framework provides a more formal and standardized definition of attacker model for CPS, enabling the use of well-defined and uniform attacker models in the future.},

These are, however, not efficient for large networks. We propose an identity-based approach to that problem which is simple and applicable to networks of arbitrary size. With the solution proposed, the user group can, furthermore, be extended at will. Each new user needs only to visit a key authentication center (KAC) once and is from then on able to exchange authenticated keys with each other user of the network. We expect this type of approach, which was originally conceived for authentication and signatures, to play an increasing role in the solution of all types of key distribution problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the control of a class of discrete event processes, i.e. processes that are discrete, asynchronous and possibly nondeter-ministic. The controlled process is described as the generator of a formal language, while the controller, or supervisor, is constructed from the grammar of a specified target language that incorporates the desired closed-loop system behavior. The existence problem for a supervisor is reduced to finding the largest controllable language contained in a given legal language. Two examples are provided.},

	Abstract = {Applications of modal logics are abundant in computer science, and a large number of structurally different modal logics have been successfully employed in a diverse spectrum of application contexts. Coalgebraic semantics, on the other hand, provides a uniform and encompassing view on the large variety of specific logics used in particular domains. The coalgebraic approach is generic and compositional: tools and techniques simultaneously apply to a large class of application areas and can, moreover, be combined in a modular way. In particular, this facilitates a pick-and-choose approach to domain-specific formalisms, applicable across the entire scope of application areas, leading to generic software tools that are easier to design, to implement and to maintain. This paper substantiates the authors' firm belief that the systematic exploitation of the coalgebraic nature of modal logic will not only have impact on the field of modal logic itself but also lead to significant progress in },

In [4,7] we have indeed shown that the Non Interference property called NDC can be applied also in the area of network security, for the analysis of typical cryptographic protocol properties (e.g., authentication, non-repudiation). In this paper we extend the results of [4,7] by showing that NDC can be also easily adapted to detect secrecy attacks over networks.},

@article{byzantine-generals-problem,
	Abstract = {I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves. (For example, it has probably received more attention in the theory community than the readers/writers problem, which illustrates the same principles and has much more practical importance.) I believed that the problem introduced in [41] was very important and deserved the attention of computer scientists. The popularity of the dining philosophers problem taught me that the best way to attract attention to a problem is to present it in terms of a story.

There is a problem in distributed computing that is sometimes called the Chinese Generals Problem, in which two generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive. I stole the idea of the generals and posed the problem in terms of a group of generals, some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision. I wanted to assign the generals a nationality that would not offend any readers. At the time, Albania was a completely closed society, and I felt it unlikely that there would be any Albanians around to object, so the original title of this paper was The Albanian Generals Problem. Jack Goldberg was smart enough to realize that there were Albanians in the world outside Albania, and Albania might not always be a black hole, so he suggested that I find another name. The obviously more appropriate Byzantine generals then occurred to me.

The main reason for writing this paper was to assign the new name to the problem. But a new paper needed new results as well. I came up with a simpler way to describe the general 3n+1-processor algorithm. (Shostak's 4-processor algorithm was subtle but easy to understand; Pease's generalization was a remarkable tour de force.) We also added a generalization to networks that were not completely connected. (I don't remember whose work that was.) I also added some discussion of practical implementation details.},

@article{ToSplitOrToGroup,
	Abstract = {Hardware systems complexity has constantly increased in recent years. Guaranteeing their correctness is a must. Formal verification techniques, such as model checking, now play a major role in industrial environments. Their efficiency in dealing with large sets of properties is crucial. This paper deals with property grouping, decomposition, and coverage in model checking. Property grouping is a valuable solution whenever several properties must be proved for a single model. As such sets may include ``easy-to-prove'' and/or ``similar'' properties, grouping can reduce overhead avoiding sub-tasks repetition. Property decomposition, following the divide-and-conquer paradigm, can be effective whenever a property turns out to be ``hard-to-prove.'' Our contribution is a heuristic property manager, running on top of a multi-engine model checking portfolio, aiming at productivity optimization. We compare different clustering heuristics, and we exploit decomposition strategies for property sub-setting. We also consider the problem of evaluating a coverage measure for properties, used to monitor the ``advancement'' of the verification task.},

@inproceedings{BMCWithoutBDDs,
	Abstract = {Symbolic Model Checking [3], [14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. BDDs [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like St{\aa}lmarck's Method [16] or the Davis {\&} Putnam Procedure [7], can replace BDDs. This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.},

@inproceedings{IC3,
	Abstract = {A new form of SAT-based symbolic model checking is described. Instead of unrolling the transition relation, it incrementally generates clauses that are inductive relative to (and augment) stepwise approximate reachability information. In this way, the algorithm gradually refines the property, eventually producing either an inductive strengthening of the property or a counterexample trace. Our experimental studies show that induction is a powerful tool for generalizing the unreachability of given error states: it can refine away many states at once, and it is effective at focusing the proof search on aspects of the transition system relevant to the property. Furthermore, the incremental structure of the algorithm lends itself to a parallel implementation.},

abstract="In this work, we study the problem of verification of systems in the presence of attackers using bounded model checking. Given a system and a set of security requirements, we present a methodology to generate and classify attackers, mapping them to the set of requirements that they can break. A naive approach suffers from the same shortcomings of any large model checking problem, i.e., memory shortage and exponential time. To cope with these shortcomings, we describe two sound heuristics based on cone-of-influence reduction and on learning, which we demonstrate empirically by applying our methodology to a set of hardware benchmark systems.",
