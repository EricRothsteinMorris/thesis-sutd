@inproceedings{ROP2,
	abstract = {This paper reconsiders the threat posed by Shacham's "return-oriented programming" -- a technique by which W-xor-X-style hardware protections are evaded via carefully crafted stack frames that divert control flow into the middle of existing variable-length x86 instructions -- creating short new instructions streams that then return. We believe this attack is both more general and a greater threat than the author appreciated. In fact, the vulnerability is not limited to the x86 architecture or any particular operating system, is readily exploitable, and bypasses an entire category of malware protections. In this paper we demonstrate general return-oriented programming on the SPARC, a fixed instruction length RISC architecture with structured control flow. We construct a Turing-complete library of code gadgets using snippets of the Solaris libc, a general purpose programming language, and a compiler for constructing return-oriented exploits. Finally, we argue that the threat posed by return-oriented programming, across all architectures and systems, has negative implications for an entire class of security mechanisms: those that seek to prevent malicious computation by preventing the execution of malicious code.},

@inproceedings{FastInterpolatingBMC,
	Abstract = {Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is well known for its simplicity and ability to find counterexamples. It is based on the idea of symbolically representing counterexamples in a transition system and then using a SAT solver to check for their existence or their absence. State-of-the-art BMC algorithms combine a direct translation to SAT with circuit-aware simplifications and work incrementally, sharing information between different bounds. While BMC is incomplete (it can only show existence of counterexamples), it is a major building block of several complete interpolation-based model checking algorithms. However, traditional interpolation is incompatible with optimized BMC. Hence, these algorithms rely on simple BMC engines that significantly hinder their performance. In this paper, we present a Fast Interpolating BMC (Fib) that combines state-of-the-art BMC techniques with interpolation. We show how to interpolate in the presence of circuit-aware simplifications and in the context of incremental solving. We evaluate our implementation of Fib in AVY, an interpolating property directed model checker, and show that it has a great positive effect on the overall performance. With the Fib, AVY outperforms ABC implementation of Pdr on both HWMCC'13 and HWMCC'14 benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{EfficientComputationOfRecurrenceDiameters,
	Abstract = {SAT based Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is an efficient method for detecting logical errors in finite-state transition systems. Given a transition system, an LTL property, and a user defined bound k, a bounded model checker generates a propositional formula that is satisfiable if and only if a counterexample to the property of length up to k exists. Standard SAT checkers can be used to check this formula.BMCis complete if k is larger than some pre-computed threshold. It is still unknown how to compute this threshold for general properties.We show that the longest initialized loop-free path in the state graph, also known as the recurrence diameter, is sufficient for Fp properties. The recurrence diameter is also a known over-approximation for the threshold of simple safety properties (Gp).We discuss various techniques to compute the recurrence diameter efficiently and provide experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of using the new approach.},

@inproceedings{ProvingMorePropertiesWithBMC,
	Abstract = {Bounded Model Checking, although complete in theory, has been thus far limited in practice to falsification of properties that were not invariants. In this paper we propose a termination criterion for all of LTL, and we show its effectiveness through experiments. Our approach is based on converting the LTL formula to a B{\"u}chi automaton so as to reduce model checking to the verification of a fairness constraint. This reduction leads to one termination criterion that applies to all formulae. We also discuss cases for which a dedicated termination test improves bounded model checking efficiency.},

@book{ActualCausality,
	Abstract = {Causality plays a central role in the way people structure the world; we constantly seek causal explanations for our observations. But what does it even mean that an eventC"actually caused" eventE? The problem of defining actual causation goes beyond mere philosophical speculation. For example, in many legal arguments, it is precisely what needs to be established in order to determine responsibility. The philosophy literature has been struggling with the problem of defining causality since Hume.In this book, Joseph Halpern explores actual causality, and such related notions as degree of responsibility, degree of blame, and causal explanation. The goal is to arrive at a definition of causality that matches our natural language usage and is helpful, for example, to a jury deciding a legal case, a programmer looking for the line of code that cause some software to fail, or an economist trying to determine whether austerity caused a subsequent depression.Halpern applies and expands an approach to causality that he and Judea Pearl developed, based on structural equations. He carefully formulates a definition of causality, and building on this, defines degree of responsibility, degree of blame, and causal explanation. He concludes by discussing how these ideas can be applied to such practical problems as accountability and program verification. Technical details are generally confined to the final section of each chapter and can be skipped by non-mathematical readers.},

@inproceedings{CPSProfiles,
	Abstract = {Attacker models are a fundamental part of research on security of any system. For different application scenarios, suitable attacker models have to be chosen to allow comprehensive coverage of possible attacks. We consider Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), that typically consist of networked embedded systems which are used to sense, actuate, and control physical processes. The physical layer aspects of such systems add novel attack vectors and opportunities for defenses, that require extended models of attackers' capabilities. We develop a taxonomy to classify and compare attacker models in related work. We show that, so far, there are no commonly used attacker models for such CPS. In addition, concepts of what information belongs in an attacker model are widely different among the community. To address that problem, we develop a framework to classify attacker models and use it to review related work on CPS Security. Using our framework, we propose a set of attacker profiles and show that those profiles capture most types of attackers described in the related work. Our framework provides a more formal and standardized definition of attacker model for CPS, enabling the use of well-defined and uniform attacker models in the future.},

These are, however, not efficient for large networks. We propose an identity-based approach to that problem which is simple and applicable to networks of arbitrary size. With the solution proposed, the user group can, furthermore, be extended at will. Each new user needs only to visit a key authentication center (KAC) once and is from then on able to exchange authenticated keys with each other user of the network. We expect this type of approach, which was originally conceived for authentication and signatures, to play an increasing role in the solution of all types of key distribution problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the control of a class of discrete event processes, i.e. processes that are discrete, asynchronous and possibly nondeter-ministic. The controlled process is described as the generator of a formal language, while the controller, or supervisor, is constructed from the grammar of a specified target language that incorporates the desired closed-loop system behavior. The existence problem for a supervisor is reduced to finding the largest controllable language contained in a given legal language. Two examples are provided.},

	Abstract = {Applications of modal logics are abundant in computer science, and a large number of structurally different modal logics have been successfully employed in a diverse spectrum of application contexts. Coalgebraic semantics, on the other hand, provides a uniform and encompassing view on the large variety of specific logics used in particular domains. The coalgebraic approach is generic and compositional: tools and techniques simultaneously apply to a large class of application areas and can, moreover, be combined in a modular way. In particular, this facilitates a pick-and-choose approach to domain-specific formalisms, applicable across the entire scope of application areas, leading to generic software tools that are easier to design, to implement and to maintain. This paper substantiates the authors' firm belief that the systematic exploitation of the coalgebraic nature of modal logic will not only have impact on the field of modal logic itself but also lead to significant progress in },

In [4,7] we have indeed shown that the Non Interference property called NDC can be applied also in the area of network security, for the analysis of typical cryptographic protocol properties (e.g., authentication, non-repudiation). In this paper we extend the results of [4,7] by showing that NDC can be also easily adapted to detect secrecy attacks over networks.},

@article{byzantine-generals-problem,
	Abstract = {I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves. (For example, it has probably received more attention in the theory community than the readers/writers problem, which illustrates the same principles and has much more practical importance.) I believed that the problem introduced in [41] was very important and deserved the attention of computer scientists. The popularity of the dining philosophers problem taught me that the best way to attract attention to a problem is to present it in terms of a story.

There is a problem in distributed computing that is sometimes called the Chinese Generals Problem, in which two generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive. I stole the idea of the generals and posed the problem in terms of a group of generals, some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision. I wanted to assign the generals a nationality that would not offend any readers. At the time, Albania was a completely closed society, and I felt it unlikely that there would be any Albanians around to object, so the original title of this paper was The Albanian Generals Problem. Jack Goldberg was smart enough to realize that there were Albanians in the world outside Albania, and Albania might not always be a black hole, so he suggested that I find another name. The obviously more appropriate Byzantine generals then occurred to me.

The main reason for writing this paper was to assign the new name to the problem. But a new paper needed new results as well. I came up with a simpler way to describe the general 3n+1-processor algorithm. (Shostak's 4-processor algorithm was subtle but easy to understand; Pease's generalization was a remarkable tour de force.) We also added a generalization to networks that were not completely connected. (I don't remember whose work that was.) I also added some discussion of practical implementation details.},

	Abstract = {Hardware systems complexity has constantly increased in recent years. Guaranteeing their correctness is a must. Formal verification techniques, such as model checking, now play a major role in industrial environments. Their efficiency in dealing with large sets of properties is crucial. This paper deals with property grouping, decomposition, and coverage in model checking. Property grouping is a valuable solution whenever several properties must be proved for a single model. As such sets may include ``easy-to-prove'' and/or ``similar'' properties, grouping can reduce overhead avoiding sub-tasks repetition. Property decomposition, following the divide-and-conquer paradigm, can be effective whenever a property turns out to be ``hard-to-prove.'' Our contribution is a heuristic property manager, running on top of a multi-engine model checking portfolio, aiming at productivity optimization. We compare different clustering heuristics, and we exploit decomposition strategies for property sub-setting. We also consider the problem of evaluating a coverage measure for properties, used to monitor the ``advancement'' of the verification task.},

This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.},

Instead of unrolling the transition relation, it incrementally generates clauses that are inductive relative to (and augment) stepwise approximate reachability information. In this way, the algorithm gradually refines the property, eventually producing either an inductive strengthening of the property or a counterexample trace. Our experimental studies show that induction is a powerful tool for generalizing the unreachability of given error states: it can refine away many states at once, and it is effective at focusing the proof search on aspects of the transition system relevant to the property. Furthermore, the incremental structure of the algorithm lends itself to a parallel implementation.},

We propose an approach for mitigating this problem by decreasing the strength of the side channels as measured by entropy-based objectives, such as min-guess entropy. Our goal is to minimize the information leaks while guaranteeing a user-specified maximal acceptable performance overhead. We dub the decision version of this problem Shannon mitigation, and consider two variants, deterministic and stochastic. First, we show that the deterministic variant is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial algorithm that finds an optimal solution from a restricted set. Second, for the stochastic variant, we develop an approach that uses optimization techniques specific to the entropy-based objective used. For instance, for min-guess entropy, we used mixed integer-linear programming. We apply the algorithm to a threat model where the attacker gets to make functional observations, that is, where she observes the running time of the program for the same secret value combined with different public input values. Existing mitigation approaches do not give confidentiality or performance guarantees for this threat model. We evaluate our tool Schmit on a number of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications with different entropy-based objectives. In contrast to the existing mitigation approaches, we show that in the functional-observation threat model, Schmit is scalable and able to maximize confidentiality under the performance overhead bound.",

abstract = {Summary Adversaries can compute the secret information of a program, such as the key for encryption routines, from side channels in the light of timing-based and access-based CPU cache behaviours. As a result, it is crucial to understand whether a program is vulnerable to side-channel cache leakage or not. Yet how we can find out such a vulnerability in a program remains a problem. In this paper, we revisit this problem and contemplate a test-generation methodology, which, in both timing-based and access-based dimensions, systematically discovers the cache side-channel leakage of an arbitrary software program. At the core of our test-generation framework is an algorithm that explores the program's input space and adapts at runtime according to observed cache performance in the executed tests. We have implemented our test generator for timing-based and access-based attack tests and evaluated it with open-source subject programs, including ones from OPENSSL and Linux GDK libraries. Our extensive evaluation effectively discloses the vulnerabilities of these real-world software to both timing-based and access-based cache attacks. We also empirically show that our test generator achieves higher and comparable effectiveness, respectively, in simulations and real hardware platforms with regard to revealing cache side-channel leakage than do state-of-the-art fuzz testing tools.},

abstract = {The constant-time discipline is a software-based countermeasure used for protecting high assurance cryptographic implementations against timing side-channel attacks. Constant-time is effective (it protects against many known attacks), rigorous (it can be formalized using program semantics), and amenable to automated verification. Yet, the advent of micro-architectural attacks makes constant-time as it exists today far less useful. This paper lays foundations for constant-time programming in the presence of speculative and out-of-order execution. We present an operational semantics and a formal definition of constant-time programs in this extended setting. Our semantics eschews formalization of microarchitectural features (that are instead assumed under adversary control), and yields a notion of constant-time that retains the elegance and tractability of the usual notion. We demonstrate the relevance of our semantics in two ways: First, by contrasting existing Spectre-like attacks with our definition of constant-time. Second, by implementing a static analysis tool, Pitchfork, which detects violations of our extended constant-time property in real world cryptographic libraries.},

@inproceedings{Kozen&Tseng2008,
	Abstract = {The B{\"o}hm--Jacopini theorem (B{\"o}hm and Jacopini, 1966) is a classical result of program schematology. It states that any deterministic flowchart program is equivalent to a while program. The theorem is usually formulated at the first-order interpreted or first-order uninterpreted (schematic) level, because the construction requires the introduction of auxiliary variables. Ashcroft and Manna (1972) and Kosaraju (1973) showed that this is unavoidable. As observed by a number of authors, a slightly more powerful structured programming construct, namely loop programs with multi-level breaks, is sufficient to represent all deterministic flowcharts without introducing auxiliary variables. Kosaraju (1973) established a strict hierarchy determined by the maximum depth of nesting allowed. In this paper we give a purely propositional account of these results. We reformulate the problems at the propositional level in terms of automata on guarded strings, the automata-theoretic counterpart to Kleene algebra with tests. Whereas the classical approaches do not distinguish between first-order and propositional levels of abstraction, we find that the purely propositional formulation allows a more streamlined mathematical treatment, using algebraic and topological concepts such as bisimulation and coinduction. Using these tools, we can give more mathematically rigorous formulations and simpler and more revealing proofs.},

@inproceedings{VirtualCert,
	Abstract = {Cache-based attacks are a class of side-channel attacks that are particularly effective in virtualized or cloud-based environments, where they have been used to recover secret keys from cryptographic implementations. One common approach to thwart cache-based attacks is to use constant-time implementations, i.e., which do not branch on secrets and do not perform memory accesses that depend on secrets. However, there is no rigorous proof that constant-time implementations are protected against concurrent cache-attacks in virtualization platforms with shared cache; moreover, many prominent implementations are not constant-time. An alternative approach is to rely on system-level mechanisms. One recent such mechanism is stealth memory, which provisions a small amount of private cache for programs to carry potentially leaking computations securely. Stealth memory induces a weak form of constant-time, called S-constant-time, which encompasses some widely used cryptographic implementations. However, there is no rigorous analysis of stealth memory and S-constant-time, and no tool support for checking if applications are S-constant-time.We propose a new information-flow analysis that checks if an x86 application executes in constant-time, or in S-constant-time. Moreover, we prove that constant-time (resp. S-constant-time) programs do not leak confidential information through the cache to other operating systems executing concurrently on virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory). The soundness proofs are based on new theorems of independent interest, including isolation theorems for virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory), and proofs that constant-time implementations (resp. S-constant-time implementations) are non-interfering with respect to a strict information flow policy which disallows that control flow and memory accesses depend on secrets. We formalize our results using the Coq proof assistant and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses on cryptographic implementations, including PolarSSL AES, DES and RC4, SHA256 and Salsa20.},

@inproceedings{FlowTracker,
	Abstract = { Information flow analyses traditionally use the Program Dependence Graph (PDG) as a supporting data-structure. This graph relies on Ferrante et al.'s notion of control dependences to represent implicit flows of information. A limitation of this approach is that it may create O(|I| x |E|) implicit flow edges in the PDG, where I are the instructions in a program, and E are the edges in its control flow graph. This paper shows that it is possible to compute information flow analyses using a different notion of implicit dependence, which yields a number of edges linear on the number of definitions plus uses of variables. Our algorithm computes these dependences in a single traversal of the program's dominance tree. This efficiency is possible due to a key property of programs in Static Single Assignment form: the definition of a variable dominates all its uses. Our algorithm correctly implements Hunt and Sands system of security types. Contrary to their original formulation, which required O(IxI) space and time for structured programs, we require only O(I). We have used our ideas to build FlowTracker, a tool that uncovers side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms. FlowTracker handles programs with over one-million assembly instructions in less than 200 seconds, and creates 24% less implicit flow edges than Ferrante et al.'s technique. FlowTracker has detected an issue in a constant-time implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography; it has found several time-variant constructions in OpenSSL, one issue in TrueCrypt and it has validated the isochronous behavior of the NaCl library. },

@inproceedings{Blazer,
	Abstract = {We present a novel approach to proving the absence of timing channels. The idea is to partition the program's execution traces in such a way that each partition component is checked for timing attack resilience by a time complexity analysis and that per-component resilience implies the resilience of the whole program. We construct a partition by splitting the program traces at secret-independent branches. This ensures that any pair of traces with the same public input has a component containing both traces. Crucially, the per-component checks can be normal safety properties expressed in terms of a single execution. Our approach is thus in contrast to prior approaches, such as self-composition, that aim to reason about multiple (k≥ 2) executions at once. We formalize the above as an approach called quotient partitioning, generalized to any k-safety property, and prove it to be sound. A key feature of our approach is a demand-driven partitioning strategy that uses a regex-like notion called trails to identify sets of execution traces, particularly those influenced by tainted (or secret) data. We have applied our technique in a prototype implementation tool called Blazer, based on WALA, PPL, and the brics automaton library. We have proved timing-channel freedom of (or synthesized an attack specification for) 24 programs written in Java bytecode, including 6 classic examples from the literature and 6 examples extracted from the DARPA STAC challenge problems.},

@inproceedings{SCEliminator,
	Abstract = {We propose a method, based on program analysis and transformation, for eliminating timing side channels in software code that implements security-critical applications. Our method takes as input the original program together with a list of secret variables (e.g., cryptographic keys, security tokens, or passwords) and returns the transformed program as output. The transformed program is guaranteed to be functionally equivalent to the original program and free of both instruction- and cache-timing side channels. Specifically, we ensure that the number of CPU cycles taken to execute any path is independent of the secret data, and the cache behavior of memory accesses, in terms of hits and misses, is independent of the secret data. We have implemented our method in LLVM and validated its effectiveness on a large set of applications, which are cryptographic libraries with 19,708 lines of C/C++ code in total. Our experiments show the method is both scalable for real applications and effective in eliminating timing side channels.},

abstract = {Real-world cryptographic code is often written in a subset of C intended to execute in constant-time, thereby avoiding timing side channel vulnerabilities. This C subset eschews structured programming as we know it: if-statements, looping constructs, and procedural abstractions can leak timing information when handling sensitive data. The resulting obfuscation has led to subtle bugs, even in widely-used high-profile libraries like OpenSSL. To address the challenge of writing constant-time cryptographic code, we present FaCT, a crypto DSL that provides high-level but safe language constructs. The FaCT compiler uses a secrecy type system to automatically transform potentially timing-sensitive high-level code into low-level, constant-time LLVM bitcode. We develop the language and type system, formalize the constant-time transformation, and present an empirical evaluation that uses FaCT to implement core crypto routines from several open-source projects including OpenSSL, libsodium, and curve25519-donna. Our evaluation shows that FaCT’s design makes it possible to write readable, high-level cryptographic code, with efficient, constant-time behavior.},

For a given program, a cache model, and an input, our CHALICE framework leverages symbolic execution to compute the amount of information that can possibly leak through cache attacks. At the core of CHALICE is a novel approach to quantify information leakage that can highlight critical cache side-channel leakage on arbitrary binary code. In our evaluation on real-world programs from OpenSSL and Linux GDK libraries, CHALICE effectively quantifies information leakage: For an AES-128 implementation on Linux, for instance, CHALICE finds that a cache attack can leak as much as 127 out of 128 bits of the encryption key.},

abstract = {We introduce Blade, a new approach to automatically and efficiently eliminate speculative leaks from cryptographic code. Blade is built on the insight that to stop leaks via speculative execution, it suffices to cut the dataflow from expressions that speculatively introduce secrets (sources) to those that leak them through the cache (sinks), rather than prohibit speculation altogether. We formalize this insight in a static type system that (1) types each expression as either transient, i.e., possibly containing speculative secrets or as being stable, and (2) prohibits speculative leaks by requiring that all sink expressions are stable. Blade relies on a new abstract primitive, protect, to halt speculation at fine granularity. We formalize and implement protect using existing architectural mechanisms, and show how Blade’s type system can automatically synthesize a minimal number of protects to provably eliminate speculative leaks. We implement Blade in the Cranelift WebAssembly compiler and evaluate our approach by repairing several verified, yet vulnerable WebAssembly implementations of cryptographic primitives. We find that Blade can fix existing programs that leak via speculation automatically, without user intervention, and efficiently even when using fences to implement protect.},

abstract="The latency gap between caches and main memory has been successfully exploited for recovering sensitive input to programs, such as cryptographic keys from implementation of AES and RSA. So far, there are no practical general-purpose countermeasures against this threat. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically deriving upper bounds on the amount of information about the input that an adversary can extract from a program by observing the CPU's cache behavior. At the heart of our approach is a novel technique for efficient counting of concretizations of abstract cache states that enables us to connect state-of-the-art techniques for static cache analysis and quantitative information-flow. We implement our counting procedure on top of the AbsInt TimingExplorer, one of the most advanced engines for static cache analysis. We use our tool to perform a case study where we derive upper bounds on the cache leakage of a 128-bit AES executable on an ARM processor. We also analyze this implementation with a commonly suggested (but until now heuristic) countermeasure applied, obtaining a formal account of the corresponding increase in security.",

abstract = {Formal verification of cryptographic software implementations poses significant challenges for off-the-shelf tools. This is due to the domain-specific characteristics of the code, involving aggressive optimizations and non-functional security requirements, namely the critical aspect of countermeasures against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we extend previous results supporting the practicality of self-composition proofs of non-interference and generalizations thereof. We tackle the formal verification of high-level security policies adopted in the implementation of the recently proposed NaCl cryptographic library. We formalize these policies and propose a formal verification approach based on self-composition, extending the range of security policies that could previously be handled using this technique. We demonstrate our results by addressing compliance with the NaCl security policies in real-world cryptographic code, highlighting the potential for automation of our techniques.},

abstract = { We present Low*, a language for low-level programming and verification, and its application to high-assurance optimized cryptographic libraries. Low* is a shallow embedding of a small, sequential, well-behaved subset of C in F*, a dependently- typed variant of ML aimed at program verification. Departing from ML, Low* does not involve any garbage collection or implicit heap allocation; instead, it has a structured memory model \`{a} la CompCert, and it provides the control required for writing efficient low-level security-critical code.  By virtue of typing, any Low* program is memory safe. In addition, the programmer can make full use of the verification power of F* to write high-level specifications and verify the functional correctness of Low* code using a combination of SMT automation and sophisticated manual proofs. At extraction time, specifications and proofs are erased, and the remaining code enjoys a predictable translation to C. We prove that this translation preserves semantics and side-channel resistance.  We provide a new compiler back-end from Low* to C and, to evaluate our approach, we implement and verify various cryptographic algorithms, constructions, and tools for a total of about 28,000 lines of code. We show that our Low* code delivers performance competitive with existing (unverified) C cryptographic libraries, suggesting our approach may be applicable to larger-scale low-level software. },

abstract = {Jasmin is a framework for developing high-speed and high-assurance cryptographic software. The framework is structured around the Jasmin programming language and its compiler. The language is designed for enhancing portability of programs and for simplifying verification tasks. The compiler is designed to achieve predictability and efficiency of the output code (currently limited to x64 platforms), and is formally verified in the Coq proof assistant. Using the supercop framework, we evaluate the Jasmin compiler on representative cryptographic routines and conclude that the code generated by the compiler is as efficient as fast, hand-crafted, implementations. Moreover, the framework includes highly automated tools for proving memory safety and constant-time security (for protecting against cache-based timing attacks). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the verification tools on a large set of cryptographic routines.},
